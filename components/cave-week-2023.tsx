        If you are a member of the NSS, we ask that you submit an email to <a>kfdrck@gmail.com</a> and request to become a member, so that we can add you to our Google Group email list. There are currently no membership dues to the Hawai’i Grotto, as this is considered a perk to your NSS membership. We will send scheduling updates to members via the Google Group.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Please be advised, lava caves here in Hawai’i are fragile. A lot of them contain historical artifacts, and significant biological specimens. So, we ask that you tread very softly while visiting caves, and please pay attention to the directions of your cave trip leaders. Proper attire for caving here in Hawai’i, are jeans or long pants, tshirts, and a good pair of hiking shoes/boots that have good tread on them. Shorts and tank tops are not recommended. Please be aware that the lava rocks are very sharp, and can cut into skin very easily. The Hawai’i Grotto has some loaner cave gear available. If you plan to attend Hawai’i cave week, just let us know if you need cave gear.

      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        The weather on Hawai’i Island is mild during the winter. However, it can get cool at night. Also, if you visit some of the caves at higher elevations, they will be cooler than the ones in the Kula Kai area. So it’s recommended that you pack a light jacket with you. Hawai’i Island has 8 out of 13 microclimates.
