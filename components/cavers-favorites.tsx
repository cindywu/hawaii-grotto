        What do Big Island cavers do when they're not caving? Why, we explore
        everything this beautiful island has to offer. See below for some of our
        favorite things to do. Please note these are not recommendations, and
        Hawai’i Grotto assumes no liability. These are simply some of our
        member's favorites.

        <a>Hikes</a>
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Prior to arriving on the Big Island, it is recommended that you visit{" "}
        <a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/" target="_blank">
          bigislandhikes.com
        </a>
        . This website will help you in planning some hiking during your visit.
        It is also recommended that you have some bug spray packed in your day
        pack. Some hikes are located in rainforests, and there are plenty of
        biting insects. Also, be sure to bring some reef friendly sunscreen.

          <a>Rainbow Falls</a> is also a favorite. It’s a short, simple walk,
          however, it’s beautiful. There’s a cave underneath the falls.

          Many cavers traverse to the summits of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. Both
          are worth the climb, but are not for the faint of heart.

          <a>Waipio Valley</a> is unfortunately closed until further notice. As
          of 02/25/2022, all trails in Waipio Valley were closed by the county
          due to unsafe geologic conditions along the access road. We are
          keeping it on our favorites list just in case Waipio Valley gets
          reopened.

        <a>Drink coffee</a>
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        For most cavers, our favorite type of coffee is not Kona coffee. Though
        Kona coffee is good, most cavers are partial to Ka’u coffee, grown right
        here close to Ocean View. Some of our favorite coffee shops are:
      </p>
      <ol className={styles.description}>
        <li>
          <a>Kalae Coffee</a> is located across the street from the Punalu’u
          Bakery in Na’alehu.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Miranda’s Farms Coffee Shop</a> is an actual local coffee farm, and
          is located between Ocean View and Na’alehu.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Coffee Grinds</a> is located in Ocean View, just a couple doors
          down from the post office, and is the only sit down coffee shop. They
          also offer a tasty breakfast, and sandwiches.

        <a>Where do cavers like to eat?</a>
      </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        Below are some of our favorite restaurants.
      </p>
      <ol className={styles.description}>
        <li>
          <a>El Encanto Food Truck</a> located at Miranda's Coffee Farm. The
          food here is made to order, and is some of the best around. Mexican
          and South American specialties. Prices are reasonable, and you will
          leave here with leftovers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Taco Tita</a> is located in Na’alehu across the street from
          Punalu’u Bakery. This is the only Mexican restaurant currently near
          Ocean View. It’s a little “hole in the wall” type place, but the food
          is amazing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Kai Loki’s Restaurant</a> is located in Ocean View, and serves up
          pub food. Some evenings live music is featured, and this is the local
          sports bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Kona Inn Restaurant</a> is located in Kona, and features food items
          from cheeseburgers to seafood, to local Hawaiian dishes. It’s
          recommended to make reservations, and when you do, request a table
          with an ocean view.

        Enjoy your time on Hawai’i Island. If you have time, take a day to just
        drive around the entire island. Wake up early, pack a cooler for a lunch
        picnic, and stop at some of the local beach parks you will find along
        the way. Plan to catch the sunrise on the east side of the island, and
        the sunset on the west side. Both are spectacular.
